# my-hello-world
this is the first repository I make, hope it will be smoothy 
i dont know what to put in these lines
do we even have a name for all those things?
its soooo weired to start like that 
good luck 
so now im in the readme-edited file now -- a copy of the original one, or a branch in GitHub glossory 
and i suppose to say something about myself 
but that is it
